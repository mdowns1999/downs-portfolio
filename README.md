# Overview

This is my portfolio website.  I made this website to try to help showcase some of the projects that I have built during my time at BYU-I and on my own.  My goal was to make it very simple with the layout and functionality. I built this site using the React framework. This is entirely a simple front-end application.  I used a JSON file to bring in my data dynamically and to make it easier to update my site. For simplicity's sake, I used a library for my hamburger button, a library for simple CSS animations, and a library for my progress bars.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code by Microsoft to program all my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I used the React framework and Vite to tie all these things together.  I also used GitHub Pages to host my web page.
