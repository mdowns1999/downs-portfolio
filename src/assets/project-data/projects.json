    "description": "This project was a team project. The purpose of this project was to receive a web page and style it without touching the HTML. This would force each of us to exercise our skills of using various CSS selectors and use our creativity to get the web page to look how we wanted it. We were also not allowed to use any JavaScript according to the rules the creator of web page made. I specifically made the header, footer and nav bar of the page. I also made the bottom part of the page with the three cards and the various buttons around it. Other parts of the page were made by my teammates.",

The goal of this project was to look at the BYUI Home page and build a similar page that looks as close to the original one as possible.  The only exceptions to this is the header and the footer of the page. This project mainly focused on the CSS styles instead of functionality with JavaScript. I had access to some of BYUIâ€™s fonts, colors, content, and icons to help get the look and feel right.  ",

    "description": "This chess project was one that I did in a team.  The goal was to make a fully functional chess program.  This program needed to follow all the rules of chess, meaning, every piece moves exactly as it should.  We also implemented special moves like castling, empassant, and promotion (though in this version you always promote to a queen).  Most of the code we wrote was our own.  The code that was not ours was the interact and Open GL Classes and libraries.  Those were written by James Helfrich, a professor at BYU-I.",

    "description": "This project is a simulation of satellites orbiting the earth.  This program allows you to fly a ship and destroy floating junk in space.  If a satellite breaks during the game, then it is the players job to go and destroy it before anything else breaks.  This program uses basic physics.  The orbiting of the satellites is not as precise as it could be since we are using simple Algebra and Geometry, but it is close enough that it looks almost like the real thing.",
